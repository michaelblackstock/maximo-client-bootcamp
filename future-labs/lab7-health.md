# Lab 7: Maximo Health Metrics & Root Cause Analysis

## Objective
Understand and analyze asset health using Maximo Health dashboards and perform root cause analysis for underperforming modules.

---

## Steps:

### **Step 1: Access Maximo Health**
1. Log in to **Maximo Application Suite**.
2. Navigate to **Health** from the MAS home page.

---

### **Step 2: View Asset Health Overview**
1. Open the **Health Dashboard**.
2. Identify assets marked as **Critical** or **Poor**.

---

### **Step 3: Drill Down into Health Metrics**
1. Select an asset with low health score.
2. Review:
   - **Charge cycles**
   - **Temperature trends**
   - **Efficiency metrics**
3. Compare health across modules.

---

### **Step 4: Identify Weak Modules**
1. Scroll to **Health Metrics 1 & 2** visualization.
2. Observe **weak modules flagged in red**.
3. Use the **Root Cause Analysis** panel to determine probable issues.

---

### **Step 5: Document Findings**
1. Add notes on identified issues (e.g., faulty inverter, high-temp module).
2. Export a **health report** for maintenance planning.

---

## Expected Outcome
- Ability to navigate and interpret health dashboards.
- Identify critical issues using Maximo Health.
- Perform basic root cause analysis for asset underperformance.
