### Key Features:
- Visualize assets on interactive maps
- Perform spatial analysis for operational insights
- Integrate seamlessly with **Esri ArcGIS**

---

## Hands-On Activities

### **1. Access the Map View**
1. Navigate to the **Assets** application in Maximo.
2. Open any **asset record** from the list.
3. Click the **Map** icon in the toolbar (usually labeled as *Map View*).
4. The **Map View** panel will open, showing the selected asset on the map.

---

### **2. Explore Map Options**
- **Switch to 3D View**  
  Use the **3D toggle** in the map panel to enable a three-dimensional representation of your assets and environment.
  
- **Zoom & Pan**  
  Use your mouse or trackpad to zoom in/out and drag the map to navigate to specific regions.

---

### **3. Visualize Defects & Conditions**
- From the **Defects or Issues** tab, select any defect record.
- These will appear on the map as **dots or pins** indicating the affected assets.
- Click any marker for quick details or to drill into asset history.

---

### **4. Use Heat Maps**
- In the **Dashboard or Map widget**, click **Add Widget** â†’ **Heat Map**.
- Configure the heat map for **energy generation** or other performance metrics.
- This provides a visual hotspot view of underperforming assets.

---

### **5. Create Work Orders from the Map**
- On the **Map View**, select the asset or defect marker.
- Click **Create Work Order** from the context menu.
- Complete the work order form and save.

---

## Best Practices
- Use **layer filters** to display assets by type, status, or criticality.
- Combine map visualization with **real-time alerts** for better decision-making.
- Leverage **Esri ArcGIS integration** for environmental and geospatial data overlays.
