# Module 4: Inventory & Procurement

## Overview
Inventory and Procurement in Maximo ensure that spare parts, materials, and services are available for maintenance tasks. This helps reduce downtime and improve operational efficiency by linking material availability with Work Orders.

## Why Inventory & Procurement?
- **Prevent Delays**  
  Ensure parts are available before maintenance begins.
- **Optimize Costs**  
  Track stock levels and avoid overstocking.
- **Integrate Supply Chain**  
  Manage procurement for items not in stock.

---

## Key Features:
- **Item Master & Storerooms**  
  Define and store details of spare parts.
- **Inventory Management**  
  Track stock levels, reorder points, and reservations.
- **Issues and Returns**  
  Record material usage for Work Orders.
- **Purchase Orders (PO)**  
  Procure items from vendors.

---

## Hands-On Activities:
1. Create a new **Item** in the Item Master.
2. Add the item to a **Storeroom**.
3. Issue the item to an **existing Work Order**.
4. Create a **Purchase Order** for an out-of-stock item.

---

## Best Practices:
- Set **reorder points** and **lead times** for critical items.

- Use **approval workflows** for POs to control spending.
