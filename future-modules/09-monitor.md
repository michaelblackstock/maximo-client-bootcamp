# Module 7: Maximo Monitor

## Overview
Maximo Monitor enables real-time visibility into asset performance using IoT data, dashboards, and alerts. It helps organizations detect anomalies, monitor critical KPIs, and prevent costly downtime. By integrating with IoT devices and data streams, Maximo Monitor empowers asset managers and reliability engineers to make informed, proactive decisions.

---

### Why Monitoring Matters
- Ensures **continuous asset availability** and minimizes downtime.
- Enables **early detection of performance deviations** before they escalate.
- Supports **data-driven decision making** using historical and real-time data.
- Provides **contractual compliance** reporting (availability, uptime SLAs).
- Helps track **operational cost** and performance against financial targets.

---

## Key Features:
- **Connect IoT Data Sources**  
  Ingest live operational data from sensors, controllers, and existing OT systems.
- **Create Dashboards**  
  Visualize energy output, asset health, and key performance indicators in real time.
- **Set Alerts & Thresholds**  
  Configure alarms for underperformance or fault conditions.
- **Analyze Performance Deviations**  
  Identify weak modules, inverter inefficiencies, or low-performing strings.
- **Predict Failures**  
  Detect anomalies and potential reliability issues before they cause outages.

---

### **3. Create a Custom Dashboard**
- Go to **Dashboards** → **Create New Dashboard**.
- Add widgets for:
  - **Energy Generation**
  - **Availability Status**
  - **Alerts Summary**
- Drag and resize widgets for a clear layout.

---

### **4. Set Up Alerts & Notifications**
- From the **Alerts** tab, click **Create Alert Rule**.
- Select a **data**
